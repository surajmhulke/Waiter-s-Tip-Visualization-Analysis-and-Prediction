## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how much tip to leave for a waiter after a meal at a restaurant? In this project, we aim to predict the amount of tip a person will give based on their visit to a restaurant, using various features related to the visit.

## Importing Libraries

In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries to handle data, perform data analysis, and develop machine learning models. The libraries used include:
- Pandas for data handling and analysis
- Numpy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks
- XGBoost for predictive modeling

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error as mae
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## Importing Dataset

We load the dataset using Pandas and display the first few rows to get an overview. The dataset contains information related to tips given at a restaurant.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('tips.csv')
df.head()
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset and the relationships between different features. In this section, we conduct various analyses and visualizations to gain insights into the data.

- Check for missing values
- Data distribution using distribution plots
- Identifying outliers using box plots
- Count plots for categorical columns
- Scatter plot for understanding relationships
In the provided code, several data visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks are performed on a dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Below, I'll provide a summary of the plots created along with their corresponding code snippets.

1. **Bar Plot for the Frequency of Days**:
   - A bar plot showing the frequency of days in the 'day' column of the DataFrame.

```python
a = pd.DataFrame(df1['day'].value_counts())
a.reset_index(inplace=True)
plt.bar(a['index'], a['day'])
plt.show()
```

2. **Another Bar Plot for the Frequency of Days**:
   - An alternative way to create a bar plot for the frequency of days.

```python
plt.bar(df1['day'].value_counts().index, df1['day'].value_counts().values)
plt.show()
```

3. **Bar Plot Using Seaborn**:
   - Creating a bar plot using Seaborn with rotated x-axis labels.

```python
sns.barplot(a['index'], a['day'])
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.show()
```

4. **Pie Chart**:
   - A pie chart showing the distribution of days.

```python
plt.pie(a['day'], labels=a['index'], autopct='%1.2f', explode=[0.2, 0, 0, 0])
plt.show()
```

5. **Pie Chart Using Pandas**:
   - Creating a pie chart using Pandas DataFrame.

```python
a.plot(kind='pie', y='day', labels=a['index'], autopct='%1.2f')
plt.show()
```

6. **Distribution Plot**:
   - A distribution plot (histogram) of the 'total_bill' column.

```python
sns.distplot(df1['total_bill'])
plt.show()
```

7. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Plot**:
   - A KDE plot with mean, median, and mode lines for the 'total_bill' column.

```python
a = df1['total_bill']
mean = a.mean()
median = np.median(a)
mode = a.mode()
sns.distplot(a, hist=False)
plt.axvline(mean, color='r', label='mean')
plt.axvline(median, color='b', label='median')
plt.axvline(mode[0], color='g', label='mode')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

8. **Box Plot**:
   - A box plot for the 'total_bill' column.

```python
plt.boxplot(a)
plt.text(0.85, 13, s='Q1', size=13)
plt.text(0.85, 17, s='Q2', size=13)
plt.text(0.85, 23, s='Q3', size=13)
plt.text(1.1, 16, s='IQR', rotation=90, size=20)
plt.show()
```

9. **Scatter Plot**:
   - A scatter plot of 'total_bill' vs. 'tip' columns.

```python
plt.scatter(df1['total_bill'], df1['tip'])
plt.show()
```

10. **Scatter Plot Using Seaborn**:
    - A scatter plot using Seaborn with 'day' as a hue.

```python
sns.scatterplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=df1, hue='day')
plt.show()
```

11. **Scatter Plot with 'sex' as Hue**:
    - A scatter plot with 'sex' as the hue using Seaborn.

```python
sns.scatterplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=df1, hue='sex')
plt.show()
```

12. **Linear Regression Plot (lmplot)**:
    - A linear regression plot (lmplot) with 'sex' as hue, markers, and a grid.

```python
sns.lmplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=df1, hue='sex', fit_reg=False, markers=['^', 's'], palette='ocean', row='sex', col='smoker')
plt.show()
```

13. **Strip Plot**:
    - A strip plot showing 'day' on the x-axis and 'total_bill' on the y-axis.

```python
sns.stripplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=df1, jitter=False)
plt.grid()
plt.axhline(20, color='black')
plt.show()
```

14. **Swarm Plot**:
    - A swarm plot showing 'day' on the x-axis, 'total_bill' on the y-axis, and 'sex' as a hue.

```python
sns.swarmplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=df1, hue='sex')
plt.grid()
plt.axhline(20, color='black')
plt.show()
```

15. **Correlation Heatmap**:
    - A heatmap

## Feature Engineering

We preprocess the data by encoding categorical features using Label Encoding. This ensures that all columns are in numerical format for model training.

## Model Development and Evaluation

We split the data into training and validation sets and standardize the numerical features. Then, we train various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, XGBoost, RandomForest, and AdaBoost. We evaluate the models based on the mean absolute error for both training and validation data. RandomForestRegressor yields the best results with the lowest error.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, even with a small dataset, we were able to derive meaningful insights and create a predictive model for tip estimation. A larger dataset could provide more detailed patterns in the relationships between independent features and tip amounts.

This project showcases how machine learning can be used to predict tips, which can be valuable in the restaurant industry for understanding customer behavior and improving service.

Feel free to explore and expand upon this project further to enhance its predictive accuracy.
